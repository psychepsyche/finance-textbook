# Kaobook

A LaTeX class for books, reports or theses.

## Credits

This class is based on the work of [Ken Arroyo 
Ohori](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/ken/en/) for his doctoral thesis. The 
main ideas behind the layout can be found in this [blog 
post](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/ken/en/2016/04/17/a-1.5-column-layout-in-latex.html). 
The [Tufte-LaTeX class](https://github.com/Tufte-LaTeX/tufte-latex) has 
also been a source of ideas about the layout.

## Documentation

The class is documented and exemplified in the [main.pdf](main.pdf) 
file.

## Contributing

Do you like the design? Why don't you try to improve it? Any 
contribution is welcome!

P.S. Work is in progress to post the template at 
[LaTeXTemplates](https://www.latextemplates.com), therefore from now on 
the code should meet the requirements for the site: extensive commenting 
and separation of content into clearly labelled blocks.
